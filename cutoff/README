Investigation of DMX sound length cutoffs.

The DMX sound library seems to discard sound effects that are less
than a certain number of samples in length.  The number of samples
depends on the sample rate of the sound effect ...

Included here are various sound files. Rename to dspistol.lmp and run with
doom2.exe -file dspistol.lmp to try out.

11025Hz

silent.lmp         - 48 samples long, not played
notsilnt.lmp       - 49 samples long, played

22050Hz

silent2.lmp        - 49 samples long, not played
notsiln2.lmp       - 50 samples long, played

44100Hz

silent4.lmp        - 51 samples long, not played
notsiln4.lmp       - 52 samples long, played

Looks like:

cutoff = 48 + samplerate / 11025

if length < cutoff:
    discard
