== 90degrot.wav ==

This is a WAV file recorded from Vanilla Doom in DOSbox in E2M2.  I
stood in front of the crushing ceilings, which make a constant moving
sound.

 * At first I'm facing the crushing ceilings dead on.
 * After a few seconds I turn 90 degrees to the right (crushing
   ceilings now on the left).
 * After a few more seconds I turn 90 degrees to the right again
   (crushing ceilings behind me).
 * After a few more seconds I turn 90 degrees to the right again
   (crushing ceilings on my right).

Results:
 * When facing dead on, the peak amplitude is at around 0.45 on both
   channels.
 * With the crushing ceilings on my left, the left channel peaks at
   around 0.5, while the right channel peaks at around 0.25.
 * With the crushing ceilings on my right, the left channel peaks at
   around 0.25, while the right channel peaks at around 0.5.
 * With the crushing ceilings behind me, behavior is the same as when
   looking dead on.

Interpretation:
 * Stereo separation ranges only affects half the peak amplitude: it
   only drops by about half depending on the direction the player is
   facing.
 * There appears to be a roughly 10% "reserve" that is not used when
   looking dead on; this is used when the sound comes from one side.

== slowrot.wav ==

This is a WAV recorded from the same position in E2M2, but using a
control API-based program to turn the player view round slowly at a
constant speed (version of forward.exe modified to set angleturn
instead of forwardmove).
