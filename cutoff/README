Investigation of DMX sound length cutoffs.

The DMX sound library seems to discard sound effects that are less
than 49 samples in length.  A sample that is exactly 49 samples long
will play, but the same effect cropped to 48 samples will not be
played.

Included here are notsilnt.lmp (49 samples long) and silent.lmp
(identical, but 48 samples long). Rename to dspistol.lmp and run with
doom2.exe -file dspistol.lmp to try out.
