"with the destruction of the iron\nliches and their minions, the last\nof the undead are cleared from this\nplane of existence.\n\nthose creatures had to come from\nsomewhere, though, and you have the\nsneaky suspicion that the fiery\nportal of hell's maw opens onto\ntheir home dimension.\n\nto make sure that more undead\n(or even worse things) don't come\nthrough, you'll have to seal hell's\nmaw from the other side. of course\nthis means you may get stuck in a\nvery unfriendly world, but no one\never said being a Heretic was easy!"
"the mighty maulotaurs have proved\nto be no match for you, and as\ntheir steaming corpses slide to the\nground you feel a sense of grim\nsatisfaction that they have been\ndestroyed.\n\nthe gateways which they guarded\nhave opened, revealing what you\nhope is the way home. but as you\nstep through, mocking laughter\nrings in your ears.\n\nwas some other force controlling\nthe maulotaurs? could there be even\nmore horrific beings through this\ngate? the sweep of a crystal dome\noverhead where the sky should be is\ncertainly not a good sign...."
"the death of d'sparil has loosed\nthe magical bonds holding his\ncreatures on this plane, their\ndying screams overwhelming his own\ncries of agony.\n\nyour oath of vengeance fulfilled,\nyou enter the portal to your own\nworld, mere moments before the dome\nshatters into a million pieces.\n\nbut if d'sparil's power is broken\nforever, why don't you feel safe?\nwas it that last shout just before\nhis death, the one that sounded\nlike a curse? or a summoning? you\ncan't really be sure, but it might\njust have been a scream.\n\nthen again, what about the other\nserpent riders?"
