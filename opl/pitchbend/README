Constructed MIDI to test pitch bend effects.

Findings:

 * Doom ignores the least significant bit of pitch bend events

 * The "range" of the pitch bend extends over the nearest two notes,
   ie. when bent down to the minimum, notes sound two semitones lower
   than normal, when bent up to maximum, notes sound two semitones
   higher than normal.

 * The full pitch table is in doom2.exe starting at 0x0008864c

 * When bent up at the highest note, the MIDI code overflows the pitch
   table slightly and uses the next value in memory (0x36c)
