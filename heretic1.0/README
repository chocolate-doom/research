This research is for the purpose of adding HHE support to Chocolate Heretic
(raven-branch).  However, this is complicated by the fact that the DOS HHE
executable only worked with Heretic v1.0.  Furthermore, the internal state
tables changed between Heretic v1.0 and the final v1.3.  In order for loading
of HHE patches to be supported, it is therefore necessary to apply patches
against the Heretic 1.0 tables and use these instead of the normal
(v1.3) tables.

These are scripts to dump the internal tables for importing into Chocolate
Heretic.
